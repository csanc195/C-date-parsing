	The program "dateConverter.out" takes as input dates from standard input in 
the format month/day/year where month day and year are numbers, and converts 
each of the dates found to be valid into the format day/monthString/year.
A date is considered valid if all numbers are within the expected parameters
for their category, ex: a month should be less than 12 and every day should be 
less than the limit for its indicated month. The year entered should be less 
or equal to INT_MAX which is the largest number that can be expressed in c 
using an integer type this number ranges from -2 ^ 32 to (2^32)-1.

The main program functionality can be described with the following pseudocode:

main(){

	TAKE COMMAND LINE INPUT VAL AS long
		translateDates(stdin,stdout,(int)VAL);

	RETURN NO_PROGRAM_ERRORS;
}




translateDates(FILE *fileIn, FILE *fileOut){
	CHAR BUFFER[BUFFER_SIZE];
	READ A LINE INTO THE BUFFER;

	PARSE THE LINE LOOKING FOR DATES OF THE FORM: 
		month/day/year	
	VERIFY THE VALIDITY OF EVERY FOUND DATE

	IF VALID
		convert the date to the format day/monthString/year;
		write the date to the output file;
}
