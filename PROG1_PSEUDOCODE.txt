	The program "dateParser.out" takes as input dates from standard input in 
the format month/day/year where month day and year are numbers, and verifies a 
certain number of correct dates, this number of dates is entered through the 
command line as input, this is the only input that the program will take
(aside from the standard input). 
	The number entered must be a number greater or
equal to zero and less or equal than INT_MAX which is the largest number that 
can be expressed with the int data type in c, which is from 
-2 ^ 32 to (2^32)-1.

The main program functionality can be described with the following pseudocode:

main(){
	TAKE COMMAND LINE INPUT VAL AS LONG
		IF(VAL IS FROM ZERO TO INT_MAX)
			parseFileForDates(stdin,stdout,(int)VAL);

	RETURN NO_PROGRAM_ERRORS;
}




parseFileForDates(FILE *fileIn, FILE *fileOut){
	CHAR BUFFER[BUFFER_SIZE];
	READ A LINE INTO THE BUFFER;

	PARSE THE LINE LOOKING FOR DATES OF THE FORM: 
		month/day/year	
	VERIFY THE VALIDITY OF EVERY FOUND DATE

	IF VALID
		write the date to the output file;
}
